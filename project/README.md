# Keyframe-Animation-Project
Put your HTML, CSS, and image files in this folder

## Goal:
Students will create a single web page project that animates one or more graphics using one or more keyframe animations and a variety of transitions and animation techniques.

## Requirements
### Folder and file structure requirements
* Create a single web page named `index.html`
* Create a single CSS document and give it a title like `styles.css` (all lowercase letters)
* Include at least 1 or more images (preferrably at least 2: one for the background and one or more for the image/s you plan to animate)

### HTML requirements
* A single web page (HTML file)
* All standard HTML5 required tags (`DOCTYPE`, `html`, `head`, `title`, `body`)
* A title (using the proper tag)
* A title (in a `h1` tag)
* A `main` element where you'll put any elements you wish to animate.
* At least one `img` element inside `main`

### Validity Requirements
* No HTML errors (this will be tested in the html tests)
* No CSS errors (this will be tested in the css tests)

### CSS Requirements
* you must have an external stylesheet ending in `.css`
* you may NOT use a style attribute in your HTML
* you must use the `animation` property on your image (at least one of the images)
* you either need to have at least 4 percentage keyframes OR at least 6 keyframes in all
* your animation must target at least 4 different properties (opacity, transform, height, etc.) 

***NOTE: in the case of transform, each type of transform counts as a unique "property" (these would be `translate()`, `rotate()`, `skew()`, etc.)***

### Animation Requirements
* You should create a background image or gradient for the "stage" (the `main` element)
* The stage should have a height applied for the animation 
* The image and animation should match (while meeting proficiency in requirements) and not seem random.

### Assignment Submission Requirements
* Student must commit and push their changes to the repo (repo has the latest work)
* Layout should not look broken at any width
* No horizontal scrollbars should appear unless the window is more narrow that a single figure
* Student must record their animation and turn it in on Google Classroom.
